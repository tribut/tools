tools
=====

A repository of tools I wrote at some point but aren't deemed worthy of their own repository. Currently this includes:

 * **irssi-notify**

   Display desktop notifications for hilights in irssi on a remote server (requires fnotify.pl and an ssh connection)

 * **Platzhalter** (German)

   Find words matching certain puzzles ("number of letters, 3rd letter is D, built from a certain set"). This kind of problem is popular among TV call-in shows, in Germany this was especially true for the now-defunct *9live* station.

   [Try the online demo](https://extern.tribut.de/platzhalter)

 * **vboxconvert**

   Perl CGI interface for autovbox. Easily generate .msg files needed for vbox from .au files.

   Currently no online demo, sorry.
