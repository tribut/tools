# a network interface is brought down (recent versions of
# NetworkManager no longer support if-pre-up.d)

# Note that this will fail for wifi if you immediately connect
# to another network instead of explicitly disconnecting from the
# current one. In this case the MAC set before network-manager
# started might be re-used (see init/randomize-mac.conf)!
